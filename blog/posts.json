Since I left and moved to the Tumblr blog I made back in 2016-ish things've been a lot better art-wise, atmosphere's a lot nicer without the constant fight for attention and this insatiable need people on Twitter feel to cause as much drama as humanly possible, and the unending \"hey, remember that group of people who consider you sub-human garbage? I need to remind you about them daily for extra internet points\" posts are becoming a detriment to my mental health. Sometimes I just need to ignore those people exist for a while y'know?<br><br>Besides that, stuff's been moving along a lot smoother there than it did on Twitter. I'm sitting at about 40 followers now, and the exact same engagement rate I had on Twitter with over 400. Besides just that one statistic people are actually *interacting*, doing more than just clicking the like button and moving on, it feels nice<br><br>I think I'll be staying on Tumblr for a while, with my second page staying where it's always been. Unless Twitter somehow pulls a 180 and becomes something other than an unbearable cesspit of hatred I'll be staying there, or somewhere else if I find a better alternative"
