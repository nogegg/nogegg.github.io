    ## Current State of Development
Hi all,

To anyone reading this; If you are currently using Kit's modlog functionality or any custom prefixes (ie. using '!help instead' of the default 'k?help'), you may see a lapse in both of these services

Discord is currently imposing a new restriction on message content access, to prevent any bad actors from violating the privacy of their users

While Kit does fall under the umbrella of moderation bots and is likely to be accepted, due to a mistake with the first application, it had to be re-submitted. Since the dealine is coming soon (April 30th), and Kit is just on the edge of being in 100 guilds, these may not function until Discord replies to my second request

Until then, all bot functions that do not involve monitoring messages will work perfectly fine (Kick/ban commands, mute etc.), while commands and functions that do require it will not (Any modlog functionality, some of the Profile functionality, and server passwords)

Additionally, custom prefixes (and the bot's default) will also cease to function, so the bot will have to be used via mentioning it (ie. '@Kit help' instead of 'k?help') until I'm able to find the time to impliment slash commands, hopefully in the near future

As stated before, if Kit either doesn't hit the 100 guild mark or I recieve a reply in the next month or so, none of this will matter and Kit will continue functioning as normal, this message is merely meant as a warning *in case* it does

If you find any issues that arrise because of this, or just need any help in general, you can always find me in Kit's support server (the link is in the bot's bio), or send me a detailed report using '@Kit reportbug' (please review the help information first) and I'll do my best

Thanks,
Kab
